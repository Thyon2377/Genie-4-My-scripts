# parameters are sew <container1> <container2> <item> <material> <SAME>
#
# If you have <container1> and <Item> Similar but different you can use your
# inputs as follows:
#  .sew "sea bag" pack "thigh bag" cloth 0
# This will run just fine with no problem.  
#
# However, if they are both duffel bag or both sea bag or both thigh bag the
# script fouls up.  So I was forced to add another input for when they were the 
# same. <SAME>.  When they are both Duffel Bag put a 1 for <SAME> otherwise 0.
#
# Note this script is set up for stormfront.  To make it run for the wizard, 
# change setvariable tool tooltypes to save tooltypes.  Then change the line
# goto my%tool to goto my%s.
#
# This script assumes 4 big items up front.  First you have a sewing needles with
# the proper thread already put on the needles (PUT THREAD ON MY NEEDLE) and that
# there is enough thread on the needle to complete your project and in your sewing
# container1 (figure 1 yard of thread per push command on the needle, so figure on
# at least 8 pushes for most items and therefore needing 8+ yards thread minimum).  Second 
# have your tailoring book open to the correct page for the item being worked and 
# have it in your Container2, and yes the Sew container1 and the book container2
# can be the same container of you wish.  Third have your cloth or leather in your
# sewing container1 already cut to the yards needed for the project.  Fourth, any
# ingredients needed to complete the project need to be in the sew container1.  And last
# make sure you have an extra spool of thread there too.  If you run out the script 
# will try to get the extra thread and continue the project.
#
# The script will then get the book and study it, then get the scissors and cloth or
# leather out and begin the process.
