#Auto-mining Script v0.5
#
#Auto-searches rooms to mine for specified resource.
#
#Associated Globals:
#PREMIUM - YES/NO (do you have a premium account?)
#MINER_ENEMY - OFF/ON (do you want to mine in rooms where there may be enemies?)
#MINER_SWIM  - OFF/ON (do you want to try to swim to rooms?)
#MINER_CLIMB - OFF/ON (do you want to try to climb to rooms?)
#MINER_CYCLE - Value of time in second to wait for nodes to cycle if you haven't found what you're looking for.
#
#Movement uses Automapper. This may get you stuck on Swim/Climb rooms if you don't have enough Athletics.
#Mining is done utilizing the 'mining.cmd' script, you must have this in your script folders in order for this to
#work properly.
#The miner relies on your ability to effectively see what type of material is available in a room. You need
#sufficient skill in Outdoorsmanship and Perception for this to be consistent otherwise the script will skip rooms.
#
#
#Version History
# v0.1 : Initial script release, support for Wicked Burrow Mine only.
# v0.2 : Added in Abandoned Mine and Lairocott Branch Mine. Added in capability to change which rooms
#				 are searched by altering globals during run-time.
# v0.3 : Fixed issues with the Abandoned Mine variables. Fixed and added in the rooms for the Riverhaven
#				 mine. Credit to Extalis.
# v0.4 : Fixed an issue where the leading list separator wasn't being removed from the 'Rooms' before
#        evaluating the room count. Credit to Extalis.
# v0.5 : Fixed an issue with material type changes where the script would restart when finding a rare material.

##Room Lists
#Too add a mine's rooms, use the following format (for zone names that have a space, replace the space with a period).
#If zones don't have a room of a specific type, give that type a value of 'NONE'.
#
#var <zonename>.Rooms -> Basic rooms available to all with no other special conditions.
#var <zonename>.Rooms.Prem -> Rooms available only to Estate Holders (Premium).
#var <zonename>.Rooms.Enemy -> Rooms that have enemies associated with them.
#var <zonename>.Rooms.Swim -> Rooms that need Athetics for swimming to be accessed.
#var <zonename>.Rooms.Climb -> Rooms that need Athletics for climbing to be accessed.
#var <zonename>.Room.Cycle -> Room to wait in while the nodes cycle.
