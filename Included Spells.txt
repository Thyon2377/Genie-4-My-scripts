I am willing to add official Geniebuff and ritual mode support for other guilds, but since I don't play them, I'll have to rely on other players to provide the information I need.

If your non-cyclic buff or ritual spell is not in the triggers file (or is incorrect), please provide the following information in the Geniehunter support thread: http://www.genieclient.com/bulletin/topic/4644-download-combat-geniehunter-31-and-geniebuff-31/

1.	Post the official spell name and abbreviation as it appears in your SPELLS output.
2.	The messaging that you see when you cast the spell.
3.	The messaging that you see when you type POWER while the spell is in effect.
4.	The messaging that you see when the spell wears off. (You can RELEASE [SPELL] if you don't want to wait.)
